## Data

The dataset will consist of human and machine generated speech audio tracks. 

- Human generated speech will be sourced from multiple sources including but not limited to high quality in-studio and lower quality in-the-wild online recordings.
- Machine generated speech will be constructed using several SOTA TTS (text-to-speech) models. The models will be either open-source or closed-source.
- The audio files will vary in length but will be no longer than 60 seconds.
- Compression formats will also vary but the files will be saved as WAVs to simplify reading.
- The dataset will be balanced across sources. Each source (source of real audio and source of generated audio) will have an equal number of samples. 
- **This competition will be fully blind.** No data will be released. Only a small sample dataset will be released as part of a sample model.
