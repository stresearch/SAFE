# [WIP] SAFE: Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation Challenge. 
## Overview

To advance the state of the art in audio forensics, we are launching a funded evaluation challenge at IHM&MSEC to drive innovation in detecting and attributing synthetic and manipulated audio artifacts. This challenge will focus on several critical aspects, including generalizability across diverse audio sources, robustness against evolving synthesis techniques, and computational efficiency to enable real-world applications. The rapid advancements in audio synthesis, fueled by the increasing availability of new generators and techniques, underscore the urgent need for effective solutions to authenticate audio content and combat emerging threats. Sponsored by the ULRI Digital Safety Research Institute, this initiative aims to mobilize the research community to address this pressing issue. The most promising solutions will be eligible for research grants to further advance their development. 

## Data

The dataset will consists of human and machine generated speech audio tracks. 

- Human generated speech will be sources from multiple sources inlcuding but not limited to high quality in-studio and lower quality in-the-wild online recordings
- Machine generated speed will constructed using severa latest SOTA TTS (text to speech) models. The models can be either open-source or closed-source.
