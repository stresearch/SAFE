## Evaluation

All submissions will be evalulated using balanced accuracy. Balanced accuracy is defined as an average of true positive rate and true negative rate. 

The competition page will maintain a public leaderboard and a private leaderboard. The data will be devided along the sources such that public and private leaderboards will be non-overlapping. Public leaderboard will also show error rates for every source, However, the specific source name will be anonymized. See the following table as an example.

- After the competition closes, we will provide additional metrics broken down by source and other data attributes.
- This is why we ask you to provide a continous decision score for every input example in addition to a hard binary decision.

## Rules

To ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation process for the SAFE: Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation Challenge (SAFE), the following rules must be adhered to by all participants:

1. **Leaderboard**:
   - The competition will maintain both a public and a private leaderboard.
   - The public leaderboard will show error rates for each anonymized source.
   - The private leaderboard will be used for the final evaluation and will include non-overlapping data from the public leaderboard.

2. **Submission Limits**:
   - Participants will be limited to a certain number of submissions per day.

3. **Confidentiality**:
   - Participants agree not to publicly compare their results with those of other participants until the other participantâ€™s results are published outside of the IHM&MSEC2025 venue.
   - Participants are free to use and publish their own results independently.

4. **Compliance**:
   - Participants must comply with all rules and guidelines provided by the organizers.
   - Failure to comply with the rules may result in disqualification from the competition and exclusion from future evaluations.

By participating in the SAFE challenge, you agree to adhere to these evaluation rules and contribute to the collaborative effort to advance the field of audio forensics.
